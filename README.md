# MonteCarloSimulation

Monte Carlo Simulation from the ODE's given and using joint Gaussian PDF in MATLAB

Initial solution to ODE's in the file rk4.m 

Data gathering and sample of 10000 elements of initial condions simulated from file name rk4Gauss.m 

Data is saved in .dat format. and saved in data.zip 

Data analysis in data_extract_pdf.m and function file importfile.m
